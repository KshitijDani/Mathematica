PicardNoOfIterations : takes lower limit of integral, intital condition and Number of Iterations from User as input.

PicardErrorInput : takes lower limit of integral, initial condition, value of variable used to check the iteration and the acceptable error in result as inputs from the user.

Both programs print out each iteration run with the value of Y.Furthermoe, PicardErrorInput also displays the numerical value of Y in every iteration.
